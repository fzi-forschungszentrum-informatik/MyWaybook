# My Waybook - A diary for your daily tracks
This project is an attempt to use digital means to record the daily tracks of a user. 
Instead of relying on rough roundings or guesses, as they are used in analog household surveys for example, the exact length or duration of a track can be determined with the technology in a smartphone.
The idea is to record daily tracks of the user with its purpose (e.g running errands or going to work) and mode (e.g a car, bike or public transport) and possibly use/display them for data analysis.

The My Waybook prototype was developed during a student internship by Christian Rickert. The Prototype is published under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (ALv2). Read LICENSE.md for further information.

##Getting started
My Waybook is an Android Studio project, so you will need a version of Android Studio (tested with Android Studio 2.3.3).

Required Gradle Version: 2.3.3

Clone the github folder and choose "Open an existing Android Studio project" when starting Android Studio or via "File>Open..."

##Using the App
Simply open the My Waybook App and start tracking your daily tracks! Recording in areas with weak GPS signals might result in bad drawings.
